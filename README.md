# Gemini API skills

A library of skills for the Gemini API, SDK and model interactions.

## About

LLMs have fixed knowledge, being trained at a specific point in time. Software
dev is fast paced and changes often, where new libraries are launched every day
and best practices evolve quickly.

This leaves a knowledge gap that language models can't solve on their own. For
example, models don't know about themselves when they're trained, and they
aren't necessarily aware of subtle changes in best practices (like [thought
circulation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#signatures)) or SDK
changes.

[Skills](https://agentskills.io/) are a lightweight technique for adding
relevent context to your agents. This repo contains skills related to building
apps powered by the Gemini API.

### Performance

Our evaluations found that adding this skill improved an agent's ability to
generate correct API code following best practices to 87% with Gemini 3 Flash
and 96% with Gemini 3 Pro.
